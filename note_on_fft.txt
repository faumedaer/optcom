problem: set a fiber system with only 1 space step without any effect and plot the phase. The fft(ifft()) - or opposite - create error. 

partial solution:

- numpy.fft can not handle complex256 -> change to pyfftw (api which makes py interface with fftw from c) and can handle complex256 array, phase error reduce from 1e-4 to 1e-8

- created a function ifft_mult_fft() and fft_mult_ifft() to handle the case ifft( a* fft(f(x))) where a == 1  -or opposite-
