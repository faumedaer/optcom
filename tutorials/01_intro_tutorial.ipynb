    "Welcom to Optcom ! This first tutorial introduces the building blocks used to create and run an optical system. The reader is assumed to be familiar with optics and optical system network. An introduction to those topics can be found [here](https://www.elsevier.com/books/nonlinear-fiber-optics/agrawal/978-0-12-397023-7).\n",

    "An optical system in Optcom is created by linking ports of components to each other in a layout. The components represent physical components such as lasers, fibers and so on. Each component is composed of ports where a field can get either in or out, or even both. The layout allows to connect those component's ports to each other and run the simulation, i.e. propagate a field.\n"
